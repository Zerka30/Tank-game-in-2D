# Tank game in 2D with Processing

Source of a tank game in 2D made with Processing, it misses the server part but the client part partially finishes ! 
Free to imagine what we want to do several gamemode like a capture the flag or a deathmatch! 


The tank is two two rectangles so it's up to you to change that !  

Game created in cooperation with: Adam Beno√Æt
